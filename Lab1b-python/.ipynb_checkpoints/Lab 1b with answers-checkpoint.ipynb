    "This is the second part of Lab 1; it’s purpose is to show you some ways to import real data sets into Python. Real data sets are often large, come in a variety of formats, and can be finicky to deal with. Therefore, it may take you a few tries to get this working: be creative and persistent!\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Learning Goals*\n",
    "After this lab you should be able to :\n",
    "- Load a variety of real data sets into Python\n",
    "- Create and use a mask to remove missing values from data\n",
    "- Create a vector of datenumbers using a for-loop\n",
    "- Generate x-y plots of loaded data with appropriate axes and figure captions\n",

    "3. Import and Plot Your Data Set\n",
    "Import the data set you downloaded in the prelab and generate a plot from it.\n",
    "Since each of the data sets is organized differently, it is up to you to determine how to properly import it. However, feel free to show your data set to a lab TA and discuss challenges associated with importing the different data sets - some data sets are much easier to work with than others are.\n",
    "Write an m-file which will do the following:\n",
    "Load the data set you selected in the pre-lab assignment.\n",
    "Assign the data to appropriate MATLAB variables.\n",
    "Generate a plot of your data with any missing values removed. Give your plot an appropriate title and label your axes, including the correct units. If your data file contains more than one kind of measurement, choose only one variable to plot.\n",
    "Once the plot is completed, write a caption for the plot. The caption should include:\n",
    "A title for the graph\n",
    "A description of what data the plot is showing\n",
    "Axes labels including the units of the data\n",
    "Any information necessary for interpreting the plot correctly.\n",
    "Captions should be between 15 - 100 words long; the more complicated a plot is, the more description will be needed in the caption.\n",
    "For example, a figure caption for the first plot we created might look like this:\n",
    "Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2. CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm) recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory from 1958 - 2011."
