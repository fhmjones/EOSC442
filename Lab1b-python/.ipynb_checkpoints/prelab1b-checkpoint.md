    "\n",
    "## Pre-Lab Overview\n",
    "Many climate data sets are freely available online, but finding them and understanding\n",
    "the way the data is organized can be difficult. In this pre-lab assignment you will:\n",
    "1. Find a climate data set online.\n",
    "2. Examine the data format and the metadata.\n",
    "3. Learn about functions in Python\n",
    "4. Fill in the pre-lab worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you explore some of the websites given below, you will need to do some browsing\n",
    "until you understand the layout and structure of the website - once you have done this\n",
    "you will be in a position to download and understand a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please bring your chosen data set with you to lab in the form of a text file. You can bring \n",
    "it on a USB stick, email it to yourself, or use an online repository like ‘Dropbox’. You will\n",
    "use this data in the lab. <!-- this may change due to nature of notebooks -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also included a short reading section entitled Python Skills to introduce some\n",
    "of the skills you will learn this week. You do not require access to Python to do complete\n",
    "this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-lab 1 worksheet\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Find a climate data set\n",
    "You will search for and download a data set from one of the websites below. The data\n",
    "you find should be a climate time series: data that varies in time but not in space. That is,\n",
    "all measurements in your data set should be taken over a span of time at the same\n",
    "location.\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series consists of a series of dates and a corresponding series of measurements.\n",
    "Examples of a time series include Temperatures at YVR Airport between 1950 and 2000,\n",
    "or Tidal Heights at Jericho Beach on December 31, 2012, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure that the time series you choose consists of at least ten measurements, but\n",
    "most climate data sets consist of many more, usually thousands of measurements. When\n",
    "you download the data set, it should be a text file with a file extension like .txt, ~~.dat~~, or\n",
    ".csv. Avoid all gridded data or image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please download a data set from one of the following websites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment Canada National Climate Data and Information Archive <br>https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html\n",
    "- NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center Heat Content <br> https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/global-ocean-heatcontent/basin_heat_data.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Find metadata for the data set\n",
    "A text file full of numbers is not very useful without information about the format used to\n",
    "store the data. This information is called metadata: data that describes other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data you have selected, find the metadata that describes the data. Often this\n",
    "information is on the web page the data file is linked from, or it may be contained in the\n",
    "header of the data file itself. You will likely have to search around a little bit; remember,\n",
    "the goal is for you to understand the data set you just downloaded. You will require the\n",
    "metadata to complete the pre-lab worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Python Skills: Functions <!-- need to change this section based off of lab 1a -->\n",
    "You have already used some Python functions. The calls plot(), sin(), rand(), \n",
    "and xlabel() are all function calls: they perform predetermined calculations or actions.\n",
    "In general, a function requires an input argument and returns an output. However, not all\n",
    "functions require an input, and some don’t return an output. In the call\n",
    "y=numpy.sin(x)\n",
    "the input argument to the sin function is the array x, and the output is the array y.\n",
    "Likewise, in the call\n",
    "/>> xlabel('Time')\n",
    "the input argument is the string 'Time' and no output is required. Arguments and\n",
    "returns can be of any format (string, integer, matrix, …) depending on the purpose of the\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Fill out the pre-lab worksheet\n",
    "This is available to you on the Canvas website.\n",
