Python Conversions for EOSC 442 labs

Folders ending with _gh are original files with Matlab code\
Folders ending with -python are the python code files\

python folders have all lab code complete.\
Currently working on notebooks:\

Lab1a:  will be done last\
Lab1b: prelab notebook up. Part 1 and 2 of lab notebook - Ta Version running.\
Lab2: Not started\
Lab3: Not started\

*Note*: Some issues with miscorrelation between orignal TA work and Lab instructions, also so ambiguity on some minor things in translation. All issues are bolded in the notebooks for now.
