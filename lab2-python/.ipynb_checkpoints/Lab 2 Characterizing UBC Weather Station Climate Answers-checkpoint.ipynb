    "# Lab 2: Characterizing UBC Weather Station Climate\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Lab Overview*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn various pre-processing and processing that can be applied to a climate \n",
    "time-series. We will use temperature data from the UBC weather station in order to characterize\n",
    "the climate of the Vancouver area. You will plot the daily mean, monthly mean, and monthly \n",
    "mean anomaly temperature time-series, as well as the seasonal cycle. The seasonal cycle will \n",
    "be characterized by monthly means, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values \n",
    "for the daily mean temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have the data downloaded and ready to go from the pre-lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Learning Goals*\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab successfully, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect a data set to ensure the data has been imported correctly and identify some expected and unexpected signals\n",
    "- Generate a monthly mean annual cycle from a larger time series, including the monthly standard deviation, and the minimum and maximum values\n",
    "- reduce a daily time series to a monthly one by calculating monthly averages\n",
    "- construct an anomaly time series\n",
    "\n",
    "## *To hand in*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One figure containing plots of the daily air temperature, the monthly air temperature, and the monthly air temperature anomaly.\n",
    "2. A figure showing the monthly means, one standard deviation, minimum and maximumof daily temperature.\n",
    "3. Captions for each of the figures\n",
    "4. The worksheet for this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Load the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the time series you downloaded during the pre-lab in a text editor: it should start \n",
    "sometime in the late 1950’s or early 1960’s and have data recorded once per day. If this is not \n",
    "the case, you likely downloaded the data incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the time series using the pandas <code> .read_csv </code> function. Remember that you need to \n",
    "convert the date strings, which you initially loaded into Python into the ‘datetime’ format. The easiest way to check that your data has loaded correctly is to plot it."
